# Messiah
Messiah is a game moreover similar to the epic space shooter game which we all must have played atleast once in our life..<br>
The main code is written in play.py<br>
Other files are supportive like they include images, sounds, and the files named 0 to 20 are the frames for explosion..<br>
You can press o to begin and after the game ends, again press o to restart.<br>
However while playing, you will may feel like the game is on hard mode so for that, you have the whole code just edit the speeds or count of meteoroids or you can even try reducing fps <br>however it is not recommended.<br>
Still there may be few bugs which i will update with the passage of time..<br>
Also your score is the time you survived in the game in miliseconds.<br>
There is a bit loophole also, you can teleport to the left part just by moving out through the right and vice-versa is also true.<br>

Enjoy playing..
